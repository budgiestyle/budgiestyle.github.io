Iterating through an array had me stumped for a couple of days.  And after watching some video tutorials and staring at a screen I has grasped the concept.  It felt really good to be able to play my tic tac toe game that I built in Ruby.  I played it for 3 rounds and it was a draw for the first 3 games.  Seeing the game work and playing it felt really great.  Once I was done building the game it felt like I had written something that was alive, like a new creature that has actions and reactions.
