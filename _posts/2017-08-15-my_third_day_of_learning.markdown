In the world of music composition, harmony and pleasant sounds are related to mathematical formulas.  An interval that sounds good has a mathematical quality to it that makes it sound harmonious. I hope that because I learned music composition that it can somehow be related to my journey in learning to code.  That learning to read the notes and practice the scales is equated to learning the meaning of a method and writing arrays.  And as I learn little bits, I can gather them together to make a melody or a song or someday a symphony.
