I found it really refreshing to see that Ruby has a different way to write a basic conditional expression.  I see it as a way for a secretary to write in shorthand.  As I learn Ruby and view it as a programming language that can be eloquent and not only functional, I look forward to seeing more of these abbreviated ways to write code.
