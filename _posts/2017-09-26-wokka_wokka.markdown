In the midst of studying, I have found a bit of humor to keep things light hearted.  All of the learning coding stuff is stuffy and difficult.  

Today I came across the *twiddle-wakka*.  I'm learning about Ruby Gems and Bundler and am very serious about learning the material, but when I came upon the twiddle-wakka my first thought was this was a joke inserted by the person creating the lab.  Nope.  It's a real thing.  It brought up images of Fozzie Bear from the Muppets saying his punchline.  After investigating further, the twiddle-wakka is real, not a character from a Roald Dahl book.  ~>
