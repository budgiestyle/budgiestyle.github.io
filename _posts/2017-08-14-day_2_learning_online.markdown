In this journey I call career change, or learning a new skill, or learning to code, I find that my background in learning and discipline may help.  Learning a little bit every day is something that was ingrained into me while I was growing up.  I had a vigorous schedule of practicing music for hours each day, until I learned that if I practiced with focus and skill on only the parts that needed help, I only needed to devote about an hour each day.  But it took me over ten years to reach that point.  I hope that while I learn coding I will reach a point of efficient learning.
