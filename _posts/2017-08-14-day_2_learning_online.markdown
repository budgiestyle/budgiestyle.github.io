Things are going pretty well here. I'm spending a lot of time reading wikipedia and clicking on definitions of things I don't know the meaning of.  The layers go deep.  

Ruby on Rails is an interesting language to learn compared to Javascript.

I enjoyed reading about the history of computer programming.

I got my self a different chair to sit on, much more comfy.

Back to studying....
